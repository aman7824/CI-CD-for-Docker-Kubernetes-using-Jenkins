# CI-CD-for-Docker-Kubernetes-using-Jenkins
This project contains documented details of implementation of a CI CD pipeline using Jenkins for Docker and Kubernetes

# Overview 

The project focuses on implementing continuous delivery for Docker containers 🐳. The aim is to continuously build Docker images and deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster 🚀. This approach is commonly used in microservice architecture, but it can be applied anywhere containers are used.

With continuous code changes, there needs to be a continuous build and test process 🔨, as well as regular deployment of the containers 🚛. The deployment process is typically handled by the operations team 👷‍♂️, who manage the container orchestration tool like Kubernetes 🌐. However, manual deployment can create dependencies 🔗 and be time-consuming ⏰.

To address this, the project aims to automate the build and release process of container images, allowing for fast and continuous deployment as soon as code changes are made by developers 💻. This will be achieved through the implementation of a continuous delivery or deployment pipeline for Docker containers 📦.
